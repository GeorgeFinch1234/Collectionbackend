## Goal
The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Yii2 and Firebase by building a backend API. This API supports the first part of the project ([available here](https://github.com/GeorgeFinch1234/CollectionFrontEnd)), which was developed using Nuxt and Tailwind to display the data provided through the API.
